1: field and property difference
Property can have the set and get method. benefits: VS Support and thread safe. 
In class if a filed is public then it needs be changed to property, otherwise, 
should use field.


2: Constructor needs to initlize the main field and property.
If a class in instansized, then it should be consider to have complete action and property.
If a filed is not instanized in the init method, then it should be initialized in the constrctor.
eg. if a compnay exist, then it must have an CEO.
 

 3: Override and new difference
 If new keyword is used then this method is independent to the base class
 if override used then the devired class using the override class

 4: Avoid call the virtural method on the constructor

 5: method should consider public based type or interface. same as method, input and return can 
 use the based class or interface type. e.g using IEnumberable instead of Collection


 6: if method input signature is not sure but the type is same then should use the params to 
 reduce the repeat. 

 7: static and new instantiate a method is same. Meaning the way it loads to memory nad time is same.
 but it can differece, when we init a method we must have the object. If a method is only
 related with the type then it should be set to the static method, if it has relation with object then it should be 
 set to the instaniate method.


 8: Important, using extension to inject the method. Same datetime, using this keyword to wrap it
 note: the extension must be in static class which cannot be nested, the method must static.
 Not support to extend the Property and Event.
